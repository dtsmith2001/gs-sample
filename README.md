# Sample Teaching

I applied for a part-time job teaching Data Science and was asked to produce some sample lessons. However, I decided not to pursue the opportunity for personal reasons.

I decided to put the sample lessons here. I use these as a basis for Lunch and Learn presentations, as well as ideas for lightning talks at PyData Atlanta.
